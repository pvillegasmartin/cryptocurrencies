# Cryptocurrencies trader
The goal of this project is to find trading strategies that outperform the 'Buy and Hold' strategy. The final stage would be the creation of live bots to execute these strategies more effectively.

**_Current state:_** Analyzing strategies with different approaches.

**IMPORTANT:** This project will never be considered any kind of executable financial tool in real life, it is just a final student thesis.
