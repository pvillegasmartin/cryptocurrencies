# Analysis
In this section you can find the different analyses carried out.  

_**NOTE**: All kinds of approaches have been done in different time frames and with different sets of inputs. As the possible combinations of these 2 factors are infinite, all the conclusions are relative to the current moment, any of these study paths are 100% discarded._

The approaches studied to date are:

1. [Price forecasting](Price_forecast)

    - **Output**: Bitcoin price's change
    - **Conclusion**: Discarded visually. _'Persistence model'_ happens, just returning previous values.
